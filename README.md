- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using Next.js 13, the Web3UI kit, and Moralis for seamless user interfaces and blockchain integration.

- **Backend:** Solidity and the Hardhat framework are used for the backend to create and manage smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **IPFS:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is used for decentralized file storage and content retrieval.

- **Livepeer:** Livepeer is employed for livestreaming capabilities, ensuring high-quality live educational events.

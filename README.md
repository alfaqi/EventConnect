## Originality

This project is my original creation. I've built EventConnect utilizing the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** EventConnect's frontend is developed using Next.js 13, the Web3UI kit, and Moralis, ensuring seamless user interfaces and blockchain integration.

- **Backend:** We've harnessed the power of Solidity and the Hardhat framework for the backend, enabling the creation and management of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **IPFS:** For decentralized file storage and content retrieval, EventConnect relies on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

- **Livepeer:** EventConnect leverages Livepeer for high-quality live streaming capabilities, enhancing the educational event experience.

## Bonus

- **Video:** [EventConnect Demo Video](https://github.com/alfaqi/EventConnectMedia/)

  -   I uploaded the video on GitHub for privacy reasons, and I split the video into chunks because GitHub doesn't accept files larger than 25MB. I apologize for any inconvenience.

## POAP Issues

I'm encountering difficulties with the POAP website due to its request for Auth keys (Access token) and the time it takes to send them. Consequently, the automatic certificate distribution process is currently unavailable.
  - After you create your Drop, you can navigate to the POAP website to choose the method you want to use for distributing the POAP Certifications.
